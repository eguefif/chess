## Change in design
The chessboard won't be responsable for the call to board and painting.
Instead, it will send a two dimensonal array of the board with piece objects.
It will raise exceptions when move are not possible or there is a mistake.
Here are a list of method:
- Forbiden moves
- No piece on current position
- Player checked
- check mate

Then game facade will be responsible to call the board classe that I will rename terminal_board.


- Test Queen
- Test King

Implement castling
Do the is_check_mate function return boo
   Think of a class GAME
     -It would handle the main loop
     - It would handle the get move loop

   DONE Clear the terminal anytime the board is reprint.
   DONE Ask for names or randomize who play white.
   DONE  Asking for a move commencing with white.
   IN PROCESS Move a piece and check if :
        the move is possible (the player is not checked, inside the board and not on a friendly piece)
   DONE Think about how to print dead pieces

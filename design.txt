#Piece movement check
For each piece, we build a mask of the board with: 0 for empty cell, 1 for ally and 2 for foe.
Queen: uses the rook and bishop test.
King, pawn and horse: calculate every possibility in a list and check if the required move is in int.
Rool and Bishop: 
check if move is legal:
   Bishop: absolute value of current x and target x equal absolute value for current y - target y, it is legal.
   Example: 5,4 => 7,6      7-5 = 2 and 6-4 = 2
   Rook: we test vertical movement, one of the subtraction between current and target x or y is 0.
